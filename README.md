## Introduction
There are so many movies that sometimes we can't decide which one to watch.
So, Movie App shows you a random movie to watch. It also shows you information about what it's about, how long it lasts, authors, etc.
There is also an area to search for movies.

## Project overview
Movie app is an interactive web page that generates random movies to watch and also has a search area.
It provides movie plots, title, duration, year and genre.


## App description
As a first user experience, there is the main page, where you can go to get a random movie or you can go directly to search for a movie.

On the random page it provides you with a random movie and gives you information about it.

On the home page it provides you with information about other movies, there is also a search bar and you can enter the title of a movie and get information about it.
